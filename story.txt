Hi, my name is Stan and ever since my experience with that guacamole, my whole life changed. It all started at a family party, my weird Aunt Wendy came and she always brought a little goodie for me and my siblings. 
We were always taught to appreciate he odd gifts with a smile, and this time was no different. She approached my older brother and handed him an RC car, with an odd look he accpeted it graciously. Then she went to my younger
sister and gave her a set of coffee mugs. Finally, she approached me. She leaned in and whispered, "I think you're really going to like your gift this year." and handed a small plastic cup full of a green good.
I looked skeptically down at it and sniffed it. Guacamole? What was this? Anyway, I gave her a hug and thanked her. I went in to the other room and grabbed a ship and scooped up some of the green goop and ate it.
I immediately felt my body change, slowly I was transforming in to Guacamole Man!
I noticed my body turned green. What the hell? I walked in front of the mirror and glanced at my own reflection: my body doesn’t look skinny anymore, it’s much more ripped. Suddenly, I saw a weird-looking old man in the mirror and he said: “You now bear the responsibility of protecting the earth.”
